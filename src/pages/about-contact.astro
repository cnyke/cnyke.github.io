            <p>
              I am a data visualization designer, developer, and public health analyst based in Minneapolis. I studied science communication through graphic design in London, UK, before diving into a master's in public health at the University of Minnesota. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I explore biology, human health, epidemiology, and evolution through data visualization. I primarily use R, ggplot2, Python, JavaScript's D3 library, and the Adobe Creative Suite, as well as a smattering of other tools to bring datasets to life. I also write science fiction and poetry in my free time to explore future possibilities and life on Earth. I also love visual communication and illustration.
